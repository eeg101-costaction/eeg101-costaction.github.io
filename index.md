title: EEG101 - Fundamentals of Open & Rigorous EEG Science
---

EEG101 is a European [COST Action](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA24148) that unites the EEG community to reduce methodological inconsistencies by developing shared standards, harmonised datasets, and collaborative open-science infrastructure, turning principles of open and rigorous EEG science into shared tools, data, training, and practice across Europe.

By supporting training, inclusion, and cross-sector partnerships—especially through dedicated funding for early-career and underrepresented researchers and engagement with industry, charities, and policymakers—EEG101 aims to make EEG research more reproducible, impactful, and globally influential, positioning Europe as a leader in open EEG science with clear societal benefits.

## Key Objectives

- **Standardise EEG methodologies and reporting** Develop and promote standardized reporting tools, pre-registration templates, and analysis workflows to improve consistency, transparency, and reproducibility across EEG studies.
- **Integrate and harmonise EEG data and tools** Create a centralized online platform that curates FAIR-compliant EEG datasets, harmonises data across devices and laboratories, and provides interoperable open-source analysis pipelines.
- **Advance open and rigorous EEG science** Accelerate adoption of open research practices through shared resources, ethical guidelines (the EEG Manifesto), and coordinated international collaboration with major global EEG initiatives.
- **Build research capacity and skills across Europe** Deliver open-access training materials, workshops, and Summer Schools, with a strong focus on early-career researchers and Inclusiveness Target Countries, to reduce inequalities in access to expertise and resources.
- **Strengthen networking, innovation, and interdisciplinary collaboration** Foster collaboration through Short-Term Scientific Missions (STSMs), Virtual Mobility Grants (VMGs), conferences, and industry partnerships to address shared methodological challenges and stimulate innovation.

## About COST Action

[COST](https://www.cost.eu/) (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) is a funding agency for research and innovation networks. COST Actions help connect research initiatives across Europe and enable scientists to grow their ideas by sharing them with their peers. This boosts their research, career and innovation.
