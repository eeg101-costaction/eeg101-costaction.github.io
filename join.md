title: Join the EEG101 network
---

This means that you become part of an **active, international working community** committed to **open science, methodological rigour, and shared capacity building** across diverse research contexts.

Participation in EEG101 is organised through [Working Groups](/working-groups), which sit at the core of the Action. These groups shape priorities, develop shared outputs, and coordinate activities across the network. By joining one or more Working Groups, members contribute directly to the scientific, technical, and training objectives of EEG101 and help guide the direction of funded activities.

To be eligible for EEG101 activities and funding calls — including **Short-Term Scientific Missions (STSMs)**, **Virtual Mobility Awards**, and **Dissemination Grants** — individuals must be registered members of at least one EEG101 Working Group.

**There is no cost to join EEG101.** Membership is open to researchers, clinicians, students, and technical specialists at all career stages and from all countries. EEG101 particularly encourages applications from individuals based in underrepresented countries, as well as from communities and groups that have historically been underrepresented in EEG research and science more broadly. Building a diverse and inclusive network is a core principle of the Action, and broader participation is essential to achieving its scientific and capacity-building goals.

You can learn more about the scope, objectives, and governance of the Action in the official [Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)](https://e-services.cost.eu/files/domain_files/CA/Action_CA24148/mou/CA24148-e.pdf)

Whether you’re curious, experienced, or just getting started — **you’re welcome here**.
