title: Working Groups
---

The action is structured into several working groups, each focusing on specific research and coordination activities. These working groups ensure comprehensive coverage of our research objectives and facilitate effective collaboration. Each working group has a leader, a vice leader, and can consist of multiple task forces.

<div class="wide-card">
  <h3>WG1: Reporting Standards</h3>
  <p>This work package develops standardized reporting guidelines and templates to improve transparency, consistency, and reproducibility in EEG research across diverse experimental designs. It works closely with journals and the research community to pilot, refine, and promote widespread adoption of these standards.</p>

<div class="wide-card">
  <h3>WG2: Data Curation and Harmonisation</h3>
  <p>This work package curates FAIR-compliant EEG datasets and develops standardized analysis pipelines and harmonisation tools to make data comparable across laboratories, devices, and populations. Its goal is to reduce methodological variability and enable large-scale, collaborative, and reproducible EEG analyses.</p>

<div class="wide-card">
  <h3>WG3: Manifesto for EEG Science</h3>
  <p>This work package creates and promotes a community-driven Manifesto that defines ethical, open, and sustainable principles for EEG research. It aims for cultural change by engaging researchers, institutions, journals, and funders to endorse and implement best practices in open and responsible EEG science.</p>
