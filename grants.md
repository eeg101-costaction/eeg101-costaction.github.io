EEG101 will soon be inviting applications for Short-Term Scientific Missions (STSMs), Virtual Mobility Awards (VMAs) and Conference/Dissemination Grants. These schemes support training, collaboration and dissemination activities that directly advance EEG101 Working Group deliverables and strengthen our global EEG community.

Please note that applicants must already be approved members of at least one [EEG101 Working Group](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA24148/#tabs+Name:Working%20Groups%20and%20Membership) and must read the [COST eligibility and guidance section](https://www.cost.eu/am-i-eligible/) before applying. Responsibility for checking eligibility rests with the applicant. Applications that do not comply with the rules may be deemed ineligible.

### Helpdesk

**Need some guidance before applying?** 

Submit an [Expression of Interest (EoI)](https://forms.gle/PiT1473fcutvPJ5M6) to receive feedback that can help align your proposal with EEG101 objectives. This step is optional but recommended if you are unsure about the fit and feel that you could benefit from advice. Please note that this feedback will not in any way impact on the final outcome from a full proposal and to avoid conflicts of interest it is reviewed by a different team to the grants awarding committee.
