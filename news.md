## 24 September 2025 - MC1 meeting

The first management committee (MC) meeting was hosted on 24 September 2025 at the COST headquarters in Brussels.

We discussed the initial actions to be undertaken by the working groups. Furthermore, the action chair, vice chair and others of the core team were selected and voted into position.
